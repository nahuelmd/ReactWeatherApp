# ReactWeatherApp
ReactWeatherApp

I built this application using only the necessary React components and taking the data from the OPEN WEATHER MAP API {https://openweathermap.org/} 
and displays the data of interest defined in the APP.JS file on the screen.

To use it, download or clone the repository and inside the project's root folder execute the following:

To deploy in production:🧑🏻‍🚀 

npm run build

To start dev mode:👨🏻‍💻 

npm run start
(it will open your default browser at http: // localhost: 8080 /)
